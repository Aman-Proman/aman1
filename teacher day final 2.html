<LI>CONCLUSION...</LI>
</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="red" SIZE="5" FACE="cool jazz">
<p>Your sacrifices donâ€™t go unnoticed. Teachers give up their personal and family time to grade papers,
 prepare lessons, and attend conferences. Tell them their extra work means a lot to you. The compliment will certainly mean a lot to them.</p>
