<LI>TEACHERS IN INDIA:-</LI>
</FONT>

<LI>CONCLUSION...</LI>
</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="red" SIZE="5" FACE="cool jazz">
<p>Your sacrifices don’t go unnoticed. Teachers give up their personal and family time to grade papers,
 prepare lessons, and attend conferences. Tell them their extra work means a lot to you. The compliment will certainly mean a lot to them.</p>
